## About Us

Polkachu is the trusted staking service provider for blockchain projects. 100% refund for downtime slash. Contact us at hello@polkachu.com.

Polkachu is founded by a group of technology professionals who focus on providing the highest quality infrastructure and services for public blockchain networks. We believe that a decentralized world is what the future holds. We are a trusted validators on proof-of-stake blockchains. We are also a major infrastructure provider for these projects, especially in the Cosmos Ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We have 7 main infrastructure products that contribute to the ecosystem. Needless to say, all of them support Terra.

1. State-Sync: Polkachu provides state-sync servers on Tendermint-based chains. Node operators can quickly sync up a node with minimum storage requirement. Currently we support state-sync on 24 Tendermint-based chains. https://polkachu.com/state_sync
1. Node Snapshot: Polkachu provides Tendermint-based chain snapshots for node operators to quickly sync up a node. These nodes are frequently state-synced to reduce the storage requirement. Currently we support node snapshot on 27 Tendermint-based chains. https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots
1. Public RPC: Polkachu offers public RPC endpoints for developers and users on 27 Tendermint-based chains. https://polkachu.com/public_rpc
1. Public API: Polkachu offers public API endpoints for developers and users on 27 Tendermint-based chains. https://polkachu.com/public_api
1. Live Peers: Polkachu provides P2P peers on Tendermint-based chains that allow node operators to quickly connect with networks. This is sometimes more reliable than the official docs because the list on the docs can be stale while our list is retrieved from networks in real time. Currently we support live peers on 27 Tendermint-based chains. https://polkachu.com/live_peers
1. Interchain Upgrade Watcher: We keep track of network upgrades and show live consensus progress at the upgrade height. Currently we support chain upgrades on 26 Tendermint-based chains. https://polkachu.com/chain_upgrades
1. Testnet Labs: While the above products are designed for mainnets, we also offer supports for many testnets with the same product offering (mostly state-sync, live peers, RPC and API). Currently we support on 14 Tendermint-based testnets. https://polkachu.com/testnets
