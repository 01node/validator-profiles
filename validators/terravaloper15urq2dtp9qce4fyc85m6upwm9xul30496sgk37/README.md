We currently operate validating nodes on over 25 decentralised networks and have over 3 years of experience running nodes on Tendermint-based PoS chains. Our infrastructure is designed to be secure, highly available and redundant. We value contributing to Terra's ecosystem and strive to build tools and/or produce content for Terra. In the past, we have had ledger support for LUNA on Anthem and produced content such as podcasts and blog articles that highlighted the Terra ecosystem. We care about the direction of Terra and therefore also actively monitor and participate in all Terra governance proposals.
