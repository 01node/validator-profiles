Orbital command is a staking validator that is dedicated solely to the Luna ecosystem. We are a validator that is FOR the community and BY the community. 

We're not here to sit on the chain to simply collect validator rewards. No, we're here to actively participate in the community and in governance, to test new Terra builds, and to ensure that we're maintaining some of the strongest, and most secure nodes on the Terra network. Our team is dedicated to the cause to ensure that we give the community only our best.

## Team
Our team is made up of several individuals with many years of collective blockchain industry experience. We're entirely dedicated to the Terra ecosystem to ensure we're working with the community to build out the strongest network possible.
