## Profile
  
Tavis Digital is a regulated Swiss Asset Manager with a focus on Digital Assets. We strive to bring trust and institutional processes to the crypto community to ultimately attract institutional capital to the sector, and foster the inevitable changes that come upon the financial system. We believe that blockchain technology will improve processes and transparency. To achieve this we will actively participate in the governance of protocols while maintaining some of the most secure nodes on the networks we chose to support. 
  
## Team

Our team is made up of blockchain experts to operate the nodes and complemented with asset allocators used to manage billions of third party capital. The team is composed of serial entrepreneurs used to work in a regulated environment where governance is a key success factor.  The entire team is dedicated to the Terra Ecosystem to build out one of the strongest networks possible.
