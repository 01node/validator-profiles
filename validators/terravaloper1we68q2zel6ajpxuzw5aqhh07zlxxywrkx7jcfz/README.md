Coinhall provides Terra users with realtime price charts and transaction history, swap aggregations and analytics, across all AMM DEXes within the Terra blockchain. We are committed to providing the best user experience within the Terra ecosystem.

Our validator node serves two primary purpose. Firstly, it allows us to serve you, our users, with much more reliable data. Secondly, proceeds from the validator's commission will go directly into the development of Coinhall, allowing your requested features to be built out. If you would like to contribute to the development of Coinhall, please do consider delegating to our validator.

You may [reach us](#contact-us) at any time for any feature and bug requests.
