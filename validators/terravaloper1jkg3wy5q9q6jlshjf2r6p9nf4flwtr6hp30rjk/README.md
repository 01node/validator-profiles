## Ecosystem Contribution

Neptune Finance is a leveraged yield farming platform with built in automated algorithmic liquidation protection. Spreading liquidity throughout the Terra ecosystem and bringing back yields to the users.  

Neptune, in part, is focused on improving the network performance of the Terra blockchain by providing a reliable validator node for transaction confirmation, developing monitoring software to keep checks on the health of the network and deploying transactions nodes to expand the performance and decentralisation of the network.

## Use of funds

Funds gathered through staking rewards will be directed at paying for server infrastuctures, maintenance cost and improving on new vaults for Terra investors.
