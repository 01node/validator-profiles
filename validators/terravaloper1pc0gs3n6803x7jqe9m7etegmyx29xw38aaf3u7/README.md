# Staker Space

Staker Space started as a try-out and hobby with one PoS network and was turned into a full-time operation over time. We are maintaining different blockchain networks which we believe are adding value to future societies.Validating is just one piece of the puzzle in the bigger picture, but we are here to do it right!

We are small independent node-operator, that is very passionate and dedicated about supporting open networks to secure the future of the decentralized systems.

## Team

Our team consists of two, we have a good mix of knowledge that complete each other. We have extensive knowledge in system admin, networking,tokeneconomics and the blockchains we chose to validate. 

You can be sure we are dedicated to Terra as we are genesis validators and securing the votes and the network is our highest priority.
