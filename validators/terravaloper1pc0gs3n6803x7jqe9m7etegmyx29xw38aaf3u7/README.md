Staker Space started as hobby with one PoS network and turned into a operation over time. We are interested in how all different blockchains will live on and root in society. Validating is just one piece of the puzzle in the bigger picture and we are here to do it right!

By now we are small independent node-operator, that is very passionate and dedicated about supporting open networks to secure the future of the decentralized systems.

## Team

Our team consists of two, we have a good mix of knowledge that complete each other. We have extensive knowledge in system admin, networking,tokeneconomics and the blockchains we chose to validate on.

You can be sure we we are dedicated to the networks and securing the votes and the network is our highest priority.
