What sound does a TerraDactyl make? Who the **** knows, but we're here to build/support the most promising (2.0) decentralized platform that has yet to exist!

## Team

The team is comprised of a bunch of scrappy go-getters who probably spend too much time following Do Kwon on twitter...

## Architecture

Our validator nodes are deployed using dynamically scalable infrastructure that is always ready to support a growing Terra network.
