## SCV Security
SCV are a trusted provider in the Terra network offering security services for organisations, projects and smart contracts on Terra.

We believe that security requires consistent effort and vigilance. There is no one correct approach to security for everyone, with threats and vulnerabilities evolving quickly and unique to each environment. At SCV we are working to improve the security of the Terra ecosystem through open-source initiatives and researching while we engage directly with customers and protocols owners.

## Services Offering - Offensive Security Assurance

- **Advanced Penetration Testing**
    - Ensure the underlying application and infrastructure are secure against vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Adversary Simulation (Red Team)**
    - A highly targeted attack simulation designed to test all parties, providing the organisation with a realistic simulation to learn from, like "live fire" exercises. High value targets are identified pre-engagement and the Red Team engages using attacks crafted specifically for the engagement.
- **Cloud Security Assessment**
    - Review of cloud environments and their configuration against best security practices, to minimise the attack surface.
- **Security Code Review**
    - Identifying security related weaknesses in source code, ideally before deployment and before attackers get the opportunity.
- **Social Engineering**
    - We simulate an active attack or execute its impact to test the security awareness of an individual or a group of people. For example, Phishing techniques.
- **DevSecOps and Automation**
    - Ensure that the CI/CD and other automation is configured securely, to best practices, and implement automated security testing within the pipeline.
- **OSINT**
    - Finding identifying information about the organisation and any team members. Particularly information that could be misused. Anonymity could be important, and OSINT tries to break anonymity by connecting all the dots.
- **Continuous Security**
    - Any combination of the above, provided on a continual basis.
