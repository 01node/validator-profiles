## SCV Security

SCV contributes directly to the security posture of Terraâ€™s ecosystem through open-source initiatives and researching.

Our primary focus is to deliver holistic, comprehensive security assurance by employing offensive hacking and pen-testing alongside regular audits.

SCV has more than 15 years of experience in the cyber security industry and have been involved in the hacker culture for much longer. 

We recruit the best talent we can find.

## Services Offering - Offensive Security Assurance

- **Advanced Penetration Testing**
    - Ensure the underlying application and infrastructure are secure against vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Adversary Simulation (Red Team)**
    - A highly targeted attack simulation designed to test all parties, providing the organisation with a realistic simulation to learn from, like "live fire" exercises. High value targets are identified pre-engagement and the Red Team engages using attacks crafted specifically for the engagement.
- **Cloud Security Assessment**
    - Review of cloud environments and their configuration against best security practices, to minimise the attack surface.
- **Security Code Review**
    - Identifying security related weaknesses in source code, ideally before deployment and before attackers get the opportunity.
- **Social Engineering**
    - We simulate an active attack or execute its impact to test the security awareness of an individual or a group of people. For example, Phishing techniques.
- **DevSecOps and Automation**
    - Ensure that the CI/CD and other automation is configured securely, to best practices, and implement automated security testing within the pipeline.
- **OSINT**
    - Finding identifying information about the organisation and any team members. Particularly information that could be misused. Anonymity could be important, and OSINT tries to break anonymity by connecting all the dots.
