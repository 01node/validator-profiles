This validator is set up to celebrate Pete. Everyone has a Pete in their life. The person who first told them about Terra & Luna. That person for me was Pete.
The aim of this validator is to donate a proportion (initially 50%) of the coins earned to help others find out about Luna. 


## Team

Our validator is on a bare-metal, running on modern hardware, and constantly being monitored
