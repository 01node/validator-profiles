## Cosmic Validator
A staking service provider with a focus on the Cosmos ecosystem. We were selected recently by Tendermint as a top validator contributor to Cosmos and we received a large atom delegation from Tendermint to reward our efforts and our secure and proven staking infrastructure.
We focus on providing a 100% uptime and security to maximize the rewards for our delegators. In addition, we offer excellent customer service with live support via our fast-growing telegram community.

We guarantee a 100% uptime which has been proven since we have been validating in the Cosmos hub. We also minimize double sign slashing risks and any potential DDoS or hacking attacks with several security barrier layers. Our secure infrastructure is trusted by both Tendermint and the Interchain Foundation (ICF) as shown by their delegation to our staking service.


## Team
Our teamâ€™s background offers the highest possible credentials with experience in top institutions such as PwC and Bank Frick blockchain labs. In addition, our team is experienced in crypto OTC deals, previously leading blockchain startups, and has received numerous awards and recognition for their IT, DevOps, and coding skills.
