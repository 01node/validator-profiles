# Galactic Punks Validator

The Galactic Punks Validator was born out of Proposal 003 brought forward by the Community of GalacticDAO - a decentralised autonomous organisation of Galactic Punks NFT holders.

It aims to provide everyone with a possibility to stake their LUNA with a reliable, low-commission, community-led Validator. Unlike other staking providers, the Galactic Punks node re-invests staking rewards into the community treasury, used by the Galactic DAO in a decentralised way to fund developments within the NFTerra space. Indeed, the treasury has already  funded exciting events for the whole Terra community such as the NFTerra hackathon, sponsoring TeFi Miami, and partnering with Pylon for lossless lotteries.

We want to share our love for punks with all our stakers - that's why we use a part of rewards to buy and raffle off Galactic Punks NFTs! For the first four weeks, we will fund a raffle of two Punks per week from the community treasury - and after that initial period, 25% of staking rewards will be used for it in a self-sustainable way. We are grateful for the trust the community shows by staking with us - and we will work to reward that in the long term with more surprises <3
