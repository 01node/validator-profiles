# Ceres Ventures
### _**“Democratising Real-World Real Estate with Fractionalisation and NFTs”**_

Ceres Ventures aims to change the way people think about the entire property lifecycle, bridging real-world real-estate with the blockchain in unique ways that leverage the DeFi ecosystem.

Our Core Mission Builds on the **Three D**’s of DeFi:
* **D**emocratise
* **D**ecentralise
* **D**iversify
To be truly successful in our journey means doing our part to help support the ecosystems we believe in - through community engagement, education, thoughtful governance, charity fundraising, tooling and validator services.

In addition to providing both mainnet (phoenix-1) + testnet (pisco-1) validator services for Terra, we are also working behind the scenes to prepare validator services for key Terra projects that are actively building their own dedicated chain to complement both the Terra community and broader Cosmos ecosystem. Be sure to check back later for future updates!

You can learn more about our plans for the **Ceres Validator Network** via our [Medium announcement](https://medium.com/@Terrafirma_NFT/alphafriday-brighter-futures-good-friends-silver-linings-and-the-rising-cost-of-education-f23de92d2e7d).
