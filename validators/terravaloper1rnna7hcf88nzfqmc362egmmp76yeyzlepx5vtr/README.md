# JT STAKERS

We're two software engineers and blockchain enthusiasts, based in Geneva, Switzerland.
We've opted for a 100%-cloud approach with our node hosted on Digital Ocean.
As we are sensitive to quality issues, and to comply with the high expectations of our delegators, we have implemented a backup in another data center, ready to be fired up within seconds in case of a downtime at Digital Ocean. 

## Vision 

We aim at becoming a key member of the staking community, beginning with Terra and later expanding to various other crytocurrencies.
We firmly believe in the future of these currencies and will endeavour to make them stronger.

## Strategy

As we are newcomers in this industry, we understand that we need to prove ourselves before gaining the trust of delegators. 
This is why our commission will be at 0% for the next few weeks ; in addition, we pledge to never make it exceed 10%.

As our infrastructure is quite robust, we are adamant that our stability will be flawless and that we will soon be getting some traction.
