# Un Fuego 2.0

![unfuego](unfuego.png)

LUNA to hot for you to handle? Delegate to us. We can handle the heat.  

## Philosophy

We plan to burn all LUNA commission. Deposit to Anchor.

Burn baby burn...

## Un Fuego Terra Classic Thoughts...

The abuse of the LUNA printing mechanism caused a catostrophic meltdown. There are numerous governance votes attempting to correct the issue, but until a proper leadership and development team can be constructed, Un Fuego will strictly support Terra 2.0. Our thoughts go out to everyone in the Classic community.
