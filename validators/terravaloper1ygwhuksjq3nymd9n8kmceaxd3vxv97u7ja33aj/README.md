Since 2019, FreshLuna runs on bare metal in a SSAE16 SOC2 certified Tier 3 datacenter with geographically distributed private sentry nodes, YubiHSM2 hardware protected keys, with 24/7 monitoring, alerting, and analytics. Besides Terra, we run validators in more than 16 other blockchains. Please visit our website for more info.

## Our Architecture

The FreshLUNA validator is connected to our private sentry nodes in different continents.

- 99.999% Network SLA (250+ Gb/second of Tier-1 bandwidth from several providers and hundreds of network peers)
- Power Redundancy: N+1 (100% Power Uptime SLA, with Caterpillar Diesel Generators and UPS battery backups)
- Cooling Redundancy: N+1
- 24/7 security with Card Access, Biometric Access Control, dual point ID check and IP Camera Surveillance
- Independent distribution routers
- DDoS Protection 
- YubiHSM2 Hardware Security Module (proof) backed signing server fenced off from the internet
- Redundant main nodes
- Redundant Netgate firewalling around main node & signer
- Private peering via Wireguard VPN with multiple globally distributed sentry nodes
- Intel Xeon processors
- Enterprise grade disks
- Nodes on NVME SSD disks in RAID 1
- Daily node backup to RAID 10
- Daily backup of OS disk (on quadruple RAID 1) to local RAID 10 and remote cloud
- Contingency plan with cascading alerts to staff to ensure stability & continuity
- Proprietary plus 3rd party monitoring/alerting with remote logging (1 year log retention)
- More than 20 years of IT infrastructure experience

## Ecosystem Contributions

- We have made available tooling for the ecosystem ([1](https://github.com/gaia/cosmosvalmon))
- We will vote on every proposal, but when we do not have a position we will abstain.
- We are very present in the Terra Discord and constantly assisting others.
- We run a validator on the testnet.
