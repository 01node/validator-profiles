# Staker Space

Staker Space is maintaining different public blockchain networks. The reason that we decided to start this was that validating networks always needed a decentralized set. We are small independent node-operator, that is very passionate and dedicated about supporting open networks to secure the future of the decentralized systems.

## Team

Our team consists of two, we have a good mix of knowledge that complete each other. We have extensive knowledge in systems-admin, networking, security and about blockchains consensus of the networks we chose to validate on.

You can be sure we are dedicated to Terra. In V1 we were genesis validators and we will carry out with the same validation on the new Terra network. Securing the network is our highest priority.
