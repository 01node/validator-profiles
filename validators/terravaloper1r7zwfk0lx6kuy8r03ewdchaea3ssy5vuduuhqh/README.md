## Our Architecture

Our infrastructure is currently hosted on servers with the following specs (16 core, 128gb ram, 2x3.84 NVME SSD). We are in the process of procuring hardware of our own to operate from a data centre in Melbourne, Australia to further decentralisation of the Terra network.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We are active members of the Luna community and participate in all governance proposals put forward to consideration to the network.
