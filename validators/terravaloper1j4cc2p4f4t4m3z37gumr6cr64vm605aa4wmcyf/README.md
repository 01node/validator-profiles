# Moon Platoon

Moon Platoon is a community created after the Luna Classic exploit. We did not like that people who bought post de-peg couldn't vote on proposals or delegate. While we understood the reasoning behind this, we felt we didn't have a voice in the process. We decided to create Moon Platoon to make sure that in Luna 2.0 all Luna holders have a vote. We believe in putting the community first and doing our best to make informed decisions about proposals that will effect our delegators and the ecosystem as a whole. We hope that if you share the same values as us, that you will delegate to us so that we may vote for you, and earn you some sweet sweet staking rewards. We understand that you have choices when choosing validators, that's why we will always do right by the people who entrust us to serve their interests.
