ðŸ”¥ Fast, datacenter-hosted, bare-metal validators ðŸ”¥

## Team

The Aardvark validator is a collaboration between the Aardvark team and Block Pane. Aardvark is a small private capital group currently working in stealth-mode. Block Pane acts as an infrastructure provider and ensures that the Aardvark validator has the same high-availability, extensive monitoring, and security that the \[ block pane \] validators are known for.

## Our Architecture

Our sentries and validators all run on hosted bare-metal. These are spread across three European data centers, each hosted by a different provider. All systems are [extensively monitored](https://blockpane.medium.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-validator-pt-1-monitoring-2f1ec8b243bb).
