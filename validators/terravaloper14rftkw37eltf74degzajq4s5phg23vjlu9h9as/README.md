# Setten

Powering Terra with fast and reliable infrastructure âš¡

## Who we are

Setten is a swiss based blockchain infrastructure company founded by Etienne Napoleone, DevOps at Terraform Labs from 2019 to 2021.

We are now half a dozen people and growing quickly.

## Validator

We started our validator in February 2021; it has been running strong since then.

In 2022, we switched from a fully cloud-based infra to hosting the nodes on bare metal servers in two swiss datacenters.

## Service

We offer Blockchain as a Service where you can spin up Terra endpoints in a few seconds.

Our high availability LCD API provides fast and reliable access to the Terra network so you can focus on building and scaling next-generation protocols.
