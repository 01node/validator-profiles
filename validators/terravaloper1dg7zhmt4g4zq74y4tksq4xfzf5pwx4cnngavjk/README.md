Please migrate your delegated LUNA to our new Validator node ![Marte Cloud](https://station.terra.money/validator/terravaloper16gvh8amt7szjfc33yzmlzxz4xg5vrw40kchpcu) by April 30th.

This is a one time change and both validators will be running until everyone switches over. 
We can also extend the time if folks need more time. We made significant new infrastructure upgrades 
that required creating a new validator node. Full details and instructions in the link below

## Our Architecture

We run validator nodes on secure networks using high performant cloud infrastructure with latest security features.
